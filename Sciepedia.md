I never thought the current scientific research is open and inviting for laymen. And as scientific research is getting more and more specialized, and the power of research is getting even larger thus search are generating new data and science in a accelerating pace.

People, at least myself, found it more and more challenging to stay update on the frontal of, even a narrow field. This can be more true for the sciety over all. So, a more convenient and more open oraganiztion of science research is iperative.
Scientists already embrace the open access and emphasize the accessibility of research.
But that's not enough.

The burning issue is the gap between the science and the ordinary citizens, who should be entitled or even provided with easy access to the reseach fronts endorsed by the people. And if more research field presented themsevies in a accessible way, just like the open source comminity eager to share their kowledge on the new software. 
The newcomers will gain knowledge of the new fields more easily, so that they may be more like to pick up the science and even begain readily to contribute.

Last year, I imagined [A scientific wikipedia?](https://www.researchgate.net/post/A_scientific_wikipedia) and bring it up for discussion on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net). Sadly, it caught little attention.
Here I start this repository to note down my thought on this.
I hope my dream will eventually come true.
